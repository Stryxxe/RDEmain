# Custom Login Setup

Your custom login component has been successfully integrated with Inertia.js! 

## What was done:

1. ✅ Created `CustomLogin.jsx` page that uses your custom login design
2. ✅ Updated the login controller to use the custom login page
3. ✅ Configured routing so login page loads first
4. ✅ Added fallback styling for missing images

## How to add your images:

1. Create an `images` directory in `public/`:
   ```bash
   mkdir public/images
   ```

2. Add your images:
   - `public/images/bg.jpg` - Background image
   - `public/images/logo.png` - University logo
   - `public/images/google.png` - Google logo

3. The component will automatically use these images when they're available.

## Current behavior:

- Visiting `/` redirects to `/login`
- Login page shows your custom design with fallback styling
- After successful login, redirects to `/dashboard`
- After logout, redirects back to login page

## Testing:

Your application should now be running on `http://localhost:8000` and will show your custom login page first!
